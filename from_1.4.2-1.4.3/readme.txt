These files are intended for automatic updates. If you cannot run the automatic upgrades, follow these instructions:

1. Copy the files: 
From the folder "blog" from the zip to your blog root. 
From the components folder to your components folder.
Important: you should not replace entire directories, since the zip only contains files that were changed.
2. Restart ColdFusion or try going to your admin>Cache and clicking on Reload Config.
